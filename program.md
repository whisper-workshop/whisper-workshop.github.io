## Keynote Talk
### Watermarking in the Age of Generative AI: lessons learned from the past and current challenges

**Keynote Speaker:** Prof. Mauro Barni, University of Siena

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Watermarking has a long and eventful history, punctuated by early enthusiasm, theoretical breakthroughs, and some disillusionments. In this talk, I will revisit nearly three decades of research on digital watermarking, drawing key lessons from the past and examining how they apply - or are being overlooked - in the context set by generative AI. As new applications emerge, from the detection of AI generated content to model attribution, we face the risk of repeating old mistakes and missing the actual challenges posed by the applications of watermarking in a generative AI setting. I argue that rather than reinventing the wheel, we must build on established knowledge, adapting and extending it to develop solutions suited to the challenges of watermarking AI-generated content. Through a series of practical examples and conceptual insights, I outline both promising directions to follow and some traps to avoid.
